# Hundreds
A quick, easy-to-learn card game in a text-based, .exe format.
Instructions on how to play the game are included in the game itself, under the 'info' menu, but are also explained below:

            The Object of the Game:
                The object of the game is to be the last one standing. If you can't avoid
            pushing the value of the discard pile over 99, you're out of the round!
            If the game has more than 1 life for each player, the losers of every round
            will permanently lose a card from their hand, reducing their options later.
            The last player with any cards left in their hand wins!

            Taking a Turn:
                Each player's turn consists of drawing a card, then playing a card by
            entering its name and pressing enter. The game then announces the sum of the
            values of all cards in the discard pile (referred to as 'the stack' from here
            on), and play proceeds clockwise to the next player. Most cards' values are
            their face values, however some cards have special abilities.
                A player may also use their turn to fold by entering 'fold'. See the
            'Ending the Round' section for more information on folding.

            The Deck:
                The 60 cards in a Hundreds deck have a variety of effects. Here's what each
            card does:
            1-10:    Act as their face value. When played, they raise the stack by that
                     amount.
            Double:  Does not affect the stack. Instead, the next player must draw two and
                     then play two cards on their turn.
            Pass:    Does not affect the stack. It can be used as a free play, getting you
                     out of a tough spot. If you've been doubled, you'll still need to play
                     another card for your turn.
            Reverse: Does not affect the stack. Instead, it reverses the turn order. This
                     effect persists between rounds.
            99:      Instantly raises the stack to 99. It can still be played when the stack
                     is 99.
            -----
            Ending the Round:
                When you can't keep the stack from going over 99, you're out of the round,
            and will automatically fold. The round will continue until all but 1 player has
            folded. At the end of the round, if players have more than 1 life, every
            eliminated player will choose 2 cards from their hand to discard - for a net -1,
            since they would have drawn before folding - before the next round starts. This
            also means that if you were doubled and unable to complete your turn, you'll
            have to discard more than 2 cards.
                A player may also choose to fold at any point, even if they have a card they
            could have played. This may be a strategic move to save a good hand for later.
            -----
            New Rounds:
                When starting a new round, every loser of the last round resumes play with
            the same hand they had before, and the stack is reset to 0. Play resumes as
            normal from the player who would have played after the winner, taking any
            reverses into account.
            -----
            Ending the Game:
                When a player is forced to discard their last card, they're out of the game
            for good. The last player with cards left wins!
